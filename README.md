# Deprecated

Note that the DigiTrust CMP is no longer supported and will not support TCF v2. By June 30, 2020 - at the latest - all publishers should _remove_ the DigiTrust CMP and transition to a v2 compliant CMP.

At some point shortly after June 30, 2020, production releases of the DigiTrust CMP will cease to function (the javascript will do nothing) and publishers continuing to use it will no longer be in compliance with GDPR.
